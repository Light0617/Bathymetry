SRTM15 Quick Start

0. Bottom line, two scripts will run for about 36 hours total, and you're done.

1. Expand SRTM15.zip and decide where you want to place it. I use (note double srtm15)

	/Volumes/srtm15/SRTM15
	
---> PLEASE use copy/paste/find/replace the string "/Volumes/srtm15" to adapt these directions to your paths <---
	
2. Edit the include file that has all the DEM, arctic, and other paths

	/Volumes/srtm15/SRTM15/demPath.sh

3. Decide where you want to place SRTM15, and SRTM15+. (I use scratch dir "doNotBackup" 
as it's easy to keep TimeMachine from backing that dir up and wasting a lot of space)

	mkdir -p /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15
	mkdir -p /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/srtm/grd

4. Create land at 15c in 15x15 tiles, (it first downsamples land to 6c), save it for future use,
and then blockmedian all the land together. Takes about 12 hours on a MacBookPro with 16GB
and a SSD. One script will do all this for you!

The three directories with names like "doNotBackup/asterDownsampledTo6c" can be any place 
you like, but they need a total of 275 GB of free space...

	cd /Volumes/srtm15/SRTM15/com/land
	
	worldMakeAllTiles.sh \
		15c 15 15 \
		/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/doNotBackup/asterDownsampledTo6c \
		/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/doNotBackup/cgiarDownsampledTo6c \
		/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/doNotBackup/glasDownsampledTo6c  \
		/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/doNotBackup/srtm15
		
This will create a 15c land, (with a few masking issues).

			/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15
		 
4. In srtm_plus directory place a link in it to srtm land. You could create 
land directly in this dir, but it only takes one incorrect "rm", and you'll waste a day
rebuilding all the land...
	
	mkdir -p /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/srtm/grd
	
	ln -s \
		/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15 \
		/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/srtm/grd

	
5. Make the bathymetry and merge it with SRTM land, takes about 12 hours, and is done by
a single script.

---> You'll (probably) have to edit 30 lines to correct my paths for CM dirs listed in 
makeAllCmTiles.csh as described below.

	cd /Volumes/srtm15/SRTM15/com/bathymetry
	
	// check and edit paths in makeAllCmTiles.csh
	
	worldMakeAllTiles.sh 15 15 15 /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus
	
The output will be /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/grd

	e.g. for w150n30 the grids of srtm+, bathy only, sid, and KML are

	/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/grd/w150n30.Bathymetry.srtm.grd
	/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/grd/w150n30.Bathymetry.grd
	/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/grd/w150n30.sid.grd
	/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/plots/w150n30.Bathymetry.srtm.kml
	
	
All done.

=============


Steps to create SRTM15_PLUS

"land/worldMakeAllTiles.sh"

Approx runtime: 24 hrs on a MacBook Pro with SSD and 16GB of RAM.

Location: /Volumes/srtm15/SRTM15/com/land/

Bash script creates a SRTM30 like data set of land grids, but at 15c in 15x15 degree
tiles. The input parameters include the destination of downsampled ASTER, CGIAR and GLAS
tiles, but the location of the corresponding DEM these are created from are hard coded in 

	/Volumes/srtm15/SRTM15/demPath.sh
	
This keeps the number of input parameters reasonable.

The DEM are first down sampled to 6c, which is the NRL standard resolution, and then the
down sampled DEM are median filtered at the desired resolution; typically 15c. The 6c
files are about 46 GB for ASTER above 60N, 148 GB for CGIAR between 60N and 60S, and 67 GB
of GLAS/IceSat data south of 60S and also Greenland. The median filtered union of all 3 
datasets is 47GB at 15c.

Because the DEM do contain bathymetry, and because the GMT surface utility can extrapolate
wildly, the land tiles need to be masked to contain only subarial (land) data. This is a
work in progress. For the time being elevations less than 3m are assumed to be bathymetry.
In addition, the GMT utility grdsample is used to mask grd location more than 50km from a
DEM location to further elimate artifacts from surface. This step is slow and done 
approximately because the DEM data is first median filtered to 120c resolution. The output 
is reasonably good, but it is a work in progress...

Currently I know (think) land masks in 3 of the n45 tiles around the Black Sea are bad,
E15N45, E30N45, E45N45, but...

For the moment only integer math is allowed, but the resolution is arbitrary, if only
sensible at or above 6c.

"bathymetry/worldMakeAllTiles.sh"

Approx runtime: 24 hrs on a MacBook Pro with SSD and 16GB of RAM.

Location: /Volumes/srtm15/SRTM15/com/bathymetry/

Bash script creates a SRTM30_PLUS like data set, but at 15c in 15x15 degree tiles.

Assumes that land has been made at 15c in 15x15 tiles and that is either linked to or
located at

		/Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/srtm/grd

There are three steps: gather the edited pings, create tiles of predicted, combine land,
predicted, and bathymetry. The first two steps can be commented out to make things run
quickly; for example new editing pings but no new predicted. 

A typical call would be

	 worldMakeAllTiles.sh 15 15 15 /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/ /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15"

but for the moment, the linking land step is commented out to avoid disasters. I create
links by hand before making the bathy...

	ln -s "srtm15 land" /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/srtm/grd

---

"makeAllCmTiles.csh"

Approx runtime: 3 hrs on a MacBook Pro with SSD and 16GB of RAM.

Location: com/bathymetry/

This is run as part of the step to make all the bathymetry, but can be run separately to
streamline the process by commenting out calls to make predicted tiles and/or edited data.

"makeAllCmTiles" gathers all the edited CM files, and create a standardized set of 
bathymetry tiles. The code is essentially where the various directories containing CM 
files are organized into the desired tile size. 

You'll have to edit lines 40-60 that point to the various directories for the various 
agencies. Again you need to edit CM file path the arctic grid path hard coded in 

	/Volumes/srtm15/SRTM15/demPath.sh

This job obviously needs to be rerun when ever there is new or newly edited data available

The tiles along the international date line might be broken. They are supposed to have a 
1 degree pad around them, but this is tricky at the 180 rollover...

---

"makeSrtmPlusTilesInRegion.csh"

Approx runtime: Global set needs about 18 hrs on a MacBook Pro with SSD and 16GB of RAM.

Location: com/bathymetry/

---> The SRTM subarial data is assumed to be a GRD file in a particular location. I copy it
from the actual land data, but a link can be used

	ln -s "srtm15" /Volumes/srtm15/doNotBackup/srtm15_plus/srtm/grd

	
---> Land data is used as a mask to make the predicted and bathymetry tiles, and must be
present!
